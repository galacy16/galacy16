Hi all, I'm László, a student web developer in the East Midlands, with aspirations to become a full stack developer.

## Coding

#### Experience

I started my first steps in coding in late 2021, with HTML and CSS, all by my own, and in april 2022, also by my own efforts, I aquired an ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level certification. I also had a brief look over JavaScript, and after a while I have decided that I need to enroll to a bootcamp to build on these foundations, as I like it a lot.

#### Currently learning

I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the HyperionDev web development bootcamp, which is funded by the UK Department for Education. I am around 80% through the course, and I can say that it helped me a lot. I am now much more confident on what building a whole website takes, and althought there is still much more to learn (I have noticed that in this branch you'll never stop learning...) I feel that I have progressed quite a lot. In the bootcamp there is still Node and React left to learn. 

#### Future

In the future, once the bootcamp is finished, I'm looking forward to gain work in this new field, through my own company. Also, to help develop my skills further, I intend to learn Python or Angular, or why not both, with the intention to be able to build custom-made websites and/or work on various projects. 
My intensions are to become a full-stack developer, with focus on the frontend.

## Hobbies

My hobbies include sports, travelling, spending time with my family. I am also part of a small team, who started a [Formula 1](https://padlogazf1.hu/) page in hungarian, back in 2021. We also have a [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/padlogazf1) and an [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/padlogazofficial/).  
I have also started to practice the skills I gained so far in coding, making a few websites, for example, a fansite about my favourite (ex)Formula 1 driver, Kimi Räikkönen. Below you can see a screenshot from this page.
